# **Assignment 4 Progress**
**Layout**
![pa4_extendb](/process_a4/pa4_extendb.jpg)
- *Extending the backgrounds beyond the borders*
- After setting up the prototyping to make the website scroll to the top upon clicking on the menu bar, I realised that the "gentle bounce" feature made the screen "bounce" beyond the main screen, revealing the edges of any elements cropped out of the main frame. This looks unprofessional and messy, so I extended the background upwards and downwards, to give leeway for this feature.

- *A gif to mankind*
- Gifs were a serious godsend for showcasing all of the images I had in my process repository. I was able to hide away an entire series of process images and sketches into one space, while also creating visual interest in moving images! (I would argue this is applying the principle of "voluntary attention", learnt from the video editing section of this class). 
- I was also able to create moving vectors to sprinkle throughout my website to give more interest to the page. I intentionally placed gifs near areas viewers had to click or engage with, a form of breadcrumbing to "clickbait" them to engage with the different interactive elements.

- *Layout the towers of text*
- With so much content needed to be laid out into the website and only a limited about of visual attention, I decided to create pop-out tabs that viewers can click and reveal my insights in bite-sized amounts. This tucks the text away and also breaks it into much more digestible amounts.
- Furthermore, it makes things more visually interesting, as 
1. I have more space to put my images
2. It feels like discovering little easter eggs of thought, which makes the website experience more fun.

![pa4_uiimprov](/process_a4/pa4_uiimprov.jpg)
- *Improving as we're doing*
- I improved the interactive-ness of the website design as I went along, choosing at times to omit the project images altogether at the initial presentation, and then revealing the images to the viewer upon interaction. This makes the visuals simply buttons to unlock areas and engage in, which makes things more enjoyable.

**Interaction Linkages**

![pa4_overlay2](/process_a4/pa4_overlay2.jpg)
- *Overlay mechanics*
- To achieve the overlays I applied copiously to my website, I had to create frames outside my main board, ensure the overlay image is attached to the new frame, unclip content, program a click to slide in the overlay from the right direction, and make it ease in. 
- At times, like when I'm programming for the small comments/thoughts I have, I have to manually move the overlay's transition to where I want it to land on the page.
- For things like progressing the pages on the grey arrow interactions, I also have to factor in the "gentle" ease-in function, as without it the "scroll-to"s are too abrupt and aggressive.

![pa4_tshadow2](/process_a4/pa4_tshadow2.jpg)
- *Transitioning the pages: arrow shadows*
- To ensure that each scroll-to lands on the correct framing of the page that I want, I created what I called "clicky shadows", just grey circles on which was what the grey arrows "landed/clicked" to at the top of the desired page. By creating these "shadows", I could manipulate with great accuracy how high or low I needed the page to be landing into, making micro changes to the height at which these grey circles were placed on screen. 
- These grey circles were made transparent at the end of the process, hence I called them "shadows" to differentiate them from the names of the grey arrows on each section.

- *All the linkages...*
- Here's an overview of the sheer number of interaction linkages I had to incorporate into my website, for both desktop and mobile. It's really quite a lot of micro-interactions I've put in there...
__________

**Grids**
![pa4_gridb4_2](/process_a4/pa4_gridb4_2.jpg)
![pa4_gridaft](/process_a4/pa4_gridaft.jpg)
- *Grid alignment*
- There were some parts of my design that, when I turned the grid back on, were a little out of alignment. The grid was especially helpful when I was trying to arrange this section of icons. It helped to keep the spacing consistent and create a level of visual comfort.
- I was pleased that much of the text seemed to not be misaligned, and it was quick work shifting them back in place after editing.
__________

**Colour Checker**
![pa4_bcolour](/process_a4/pa4_bcolour.jpg)
- *Colour check - blue background*
- The dark blue background I used with much of my text seems to have passed the test.
__________

![pa4_gcolourb4](/process_a4/pa4_gcolourb4.jpg)
![pa4_gcolour](/process_a4/pa4_gcolour.jpg)
- *Colour check - green background*
- The original green I used seemed to be just slightly below the mark of acceptable, so I tweaked it darker just a little.
__________

![pa4_neongword](/process_a4/pa4_neaongword.jpg)
- *Colour check - green words on green background*
- To my surprise my neon green words against the dark green had sufficient contrast! It was only a matter of not putting the neon text as thin/normal text, and instead only in bold text.

![pa4_gwordb4_](/process_a4/pa4_gwordb4_.jpg)
![gwordaft](/process_a4/gwordaft.jpg)
- Just some quick adjustments to the original text and we're all set!
_______

**Final Reflections**
- Looking back on the entire semester of work, I think I've really learnt quite a lot. Figuring out sound design, film, and 3D environments for the first time, I pushed my boundaries to plunge into these new things, and I think I did better than I expected of myself. It just proves that all it takes is for you to try, even if you're not "good" at it, and we get some real fun out of the learning. 
- I thoroughly enjoyed discovering new things with my classmates, and am so thrilled when they learn all the cool stuff! I love learning from my peers, they were a great inspiration.
- It's a little bitter-sweet that this is my last post for this subject, I've rather enjoyed seeing the little areas I've gotten better. The blog has been a good place to make me sit down and reflect, tedious though it sometimes may be.
- So far we've come, and so much further to go! We've only just begun. I'm excited to explore more things next semester!
