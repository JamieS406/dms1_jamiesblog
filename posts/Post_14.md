# **Exporting Game exercises**

*Exporting Configurations*
- Exporting my game out into web-ready play for others to explore was more complex than I had previously imagined. Unfortunately for me, it appeared that my game was too big to be web-playable ðŸ¥². So I had to do a workaround by exporting it out as an application and zipped it so that it could be smaller. It's still over 300MB though... good grief...

*Material Manipulation*
- The texture I imported for the pot, a brownish concrete, was too matte to look realistic when I first applied it to the maze model. I played around with the "smoothness" and "metallic" settings in the material options until I was able to get this slightly glazed, textured tile. I really like the effect it gives, it's a lot more visually interesting and realistic!
