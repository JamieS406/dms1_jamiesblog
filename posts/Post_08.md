![20 thumbnail sketches](/w04s2/w04s2_01.jpeg)
I chose the topic "iteration" to guide my 20 thumbnail sketch exercise. I initially thought it wouldn't be too hard to create variations of a topic that literally means variance, but it got hard to make alternative forms of representing "progression" apart from arrows and points. 
- I personally felt that the 4th sketch down from the left was able to capture the messy beauty of iteration with its varying shapes and multiple directions.
- I also felt the speech bubbles building on each other (3rd moving horizontally from the left) also showed how iterations capture parts of ideas to construct better end solutions.
- Overall though, I did feel I repeated my designs a lot, and am not completely satisfied with the exploration I have done. I think the designs would benefit from more exploration and inspiration.
