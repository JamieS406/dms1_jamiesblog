I chose the topic "iteration" to guide my 20 thumbnail sketch exercise. I initially thought it wouldn't be too hard to create variations of a topic that literally means variance, but it got hard to make alternative forms of representing "progression" apart from arrows and points. 
- I personally felt that the 4th sketch down from the left was able to capture the messy beauty of iteration with its varying shapes and multiple directions.
- I also felt the speech bubbles building on each other (3rd moving horizontally from the left) also showed how iterations capture parts of ideas to construct better end solutions.
- Overall though, I did feel I repeated my designs a lot, and am not completely satisfied with the exploration I have done. I think the designs would benefit from more exploration and inspiration.

**Assignment 2 Thumbnail Sketches**
For my exploration on Assignment 2, I decided on the topic "Dream". It imagines a world where dream-travel and manipulation has been made possible, much like the movie "Inception". The icons created are to navigate and manipulate the dreamscape effectively, with safeguards around the dream perimeters if the traveller so requires.

Before I started I felt it imperative to figure out a general design direction for the set of iconography, since they are to be within the same style family. I drew inspiration from existing iconography, and was especially fascinated by the juxtaposition of gradients/halftones/blurred shapes against crisp linework. I felt it was a good visual representation for dream vs reality in the dreamscape.

Here was a little experiment I tried with the halftone and grain texture functions in illustrator, but I decided it looked a little too garish and difficult to assimilate into an iconography set. Nonetheless, it was a fun exploration.

*Disable/Enable Gravity* 
- After exploring how others have made iconography on gravity, 2 main categorys of representation appeared: either just falling things, or gravity vs antigravity. I prefer the gravity vs antigravity sets, as that solves the problem of the responsive icon and also has more room for iteration. 
- Among these, I am inclined to the
