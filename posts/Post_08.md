#**Class exercise 20 Thumbnail Sketches**
![20 thumbnail sketches](/w04s2/w04s2_01.jpeg)
I chose the topic "iteration" to guide my 20 thumbnail sketch exercise. I initially thought it wouldn't be too hard to create variations of a topic that literally means variance, but it got hard to make alternative forms of representing "progression" apart from arrows and points. 
- I personally felt that the 4th sketch down from the left was able to capture the messy beauty of iteration with its varying shapes and multiple directions.
- I also felt the speech bubbles building on each other (3rd moving horizontally from the left) also showed how iterations capture parts of ideas to construct better end solutions.
- Overall though, I did feel I repeated my designs a lot, and am not completely satisfied with the exploration I have done. I think the designs would benefit from more exploration and inspiration.

#**Assignment 2 Thumbnail Sketches**
For my exploration on Assignment 2, I decided on the topic "Dream". It imagines a world where dream-travel and manipulation has been made possible, much like the movie "Inception". The icons created are to navigate and manipulate the dreamscape effectively, with safeguards around the dream perimeters if the traveller so requires.

Before I started I felt it imperative to figure out a general design direction for the set of iconography, since they are to be within the same style family. I drew inspiration from existing iconography, and was especially fascinated by the juxtaposition of gradients/halftones/blurred shapes against crisp linework. I felt it was a good visual representation for dream vs reality in the dreamscape.

Across the iconography sets I will be showing, I intentionally did not apply colour palettes as I wanted to nail the form of the iconography first.

![Halftone fail](/w04s2/w04s2_03.png)
Here was a little experiment I tried with the halftone and grain texture functions in illustrator, but I decided it looked a little too garish and difficult to assimilate into an iconography set. Nonetheless, it was a fun exploration.

![Disable/Enable Gravity](/w04s2/w04s2_04.png)
*Disable/Enable Gravity* 
- Description: This icon is to enable or disable the laws of gravity within the dreamscape.
- After exploring how others have made iconography on gravity, 2 main categorys of representation appeared: either just falling things, or gravity vs antigravity. I prefer the gravity vs antigravity sets, as that solves the problem of the responsive icon and also has more room for iteration. 
Preferred iconography (2 sets):
1. set 10 - the lines are crisp and clearly form the shape of a plane, while adding character with the varying thickness of the line. It almost adds dimension to an otherwise 2-dimensional shape. Furthermore, The high contrast between gravity on (dark coloured star) and gravity off (white colour star) is high, so the icon will still be legible on a smaller interface.
2. set 8 - I particularly liked the radial design behind the circle and star as it could be translated easily across the other icons in a way that makes the set look cohesive. I also felt the "read" of the upward-pointing star vs the downward-pointing star was quite clear even from afar, and the tone of the radial design is a lot less than the dark circle and star. 

![Time Difference Calibration](/w04s2/w04s2_05.png)
*Time Difference Calibration* 
- Description: This icon is used to calibrate how long time passes in the dream as compared to the outside world, for example, 1 hour in real life is 1 month in the dream.
- I took reference from "dual time" and "time" icons for these sets of icons. 
Preferred iconography (2 sets):
- Specifically 7b: I felt it captured both the different "dimensions" of dream and reality, with their respective time icons. The contrast between the two made by the difference in tonal value adds to the look of 3d space. I do feel it could be improved with more polish, though.
- set 8: It's clear and needs minimal interpretation of its time duality. the black vs white clocks add to the design language being formed of black being more solid = reality and white being more airy = dream. 
- Darlings I had to kill: set 9, because I think it isn't clear enough it is dual time. The circle behind looks too arbituary in the design. 11d. as well, because even though it felt smart putting the clocks in the top and bottom parts of the hourglass it simply cannot be iterpreted clearly if it was downsized.

![Perspective Change](/w04s2/w04s2_06.png)
*Perspective Change* 
- Description: This icon is used when determining if the traveller would like be be in 1st person, 2nd person or 3rd person perspective in the dream, ie. Main character, Side character or Creator/Narrator.
- I drew inspiration from diagram plotting and radar designs for these icons.
Preferred iconography (2 sets):
- Set 3: I felt set 3 was really able to sell the idea of location plotting in a simple and effective way. The darkest "star" will be the chosen perspective (thus adequate contrast), and it shows that allocation in the context of a boundary box. I stylistically preferred the graduated line thicknesses as it made the icons less rigid and added a little dimension. Set 5 comes as a close second as a simplified version.
- Set 4: This set has the radial design signature described in "Disable/Enable Gravity", and it is able to capture the different perspectives clearly, with the help of the space created in the circle on "third person perspective" compared to the star in the middle of the circle ie. the dreamworld, showing "first person perspective". The radial design also looks very aspirational, and alludes to the way the world is described in "spheres" of existence.

![Reality Failsafe](/w04s2/w04s2_07.png)
*Reality Failsafe* 
- Description: Should the traveller end up too deep into a dream and is unsure of their bearings, they can activate this icon to pull them out of the dream to wake up into reality.
- In my research on other icons, I felt the interpretation of an eye for reality was really brilliant. As you can see all my designs were inspired by that.
Preferred iconography:
- Set 3: I think this set is particularly effective in conveying the difference between dream vs reality. The eye icon without the iris shows the state when a person is in a dream, while the iris re-appearing in the eye shows going back to reality. The space in the eye without the iris is able to give the idea of lightness, almost vacant and not being rooted to anything. Juxtaposed to the reintroduction of the iris in high contrast and linework around the eye, the icon feels a lot more grounded and present. Additionally, it carries the radial design signature, which ties it to the other icon designs.

![Change Dream Layer](/w04s2/w04s2_08.png)
*Change Dream Layer* 
- Description: A dream is seldom linear, and often melds into different narratives. I am classifying these different spaces and/or narratives as "layers", and the dream traveller is able to jump to different narratives with the help of this icons function.
- These icons relied heavily upon good translation of something moving from one place to the next. I took inspiration from "across" icons and "layer" icons.
Preferred iconography(2 sets):
- Set 11: I think this design is quite clear in its layer change. the lines around the layer shape shows the frame of reference and indicates how many layers to "jump". I think it would be easy to interpret because the design is somewhat akin to the layout of an elevator floor display, up or down.
- Set 10: I like this one also because it is clear and simple, jump forward, on the stipulated number of layers. It also has the radial design signature behind it. I do worry about how easy it is to interpret this though, someone could interpret it as exiting the dream scape by 2 layers.

![Material Fluidity](/w04s2/w04s2_09.png)
*Material Fluidity* 
- Description: This icon is used to switch on/off the laws of matter and physics. It allows the traveller to, say, turn a walls material from brick to water at will.
- I had a lot of difficulty with this icon, as I found it difficult to make it my own. I took reference from "states of matter" icons and "melt" icons.
Preferred iconography:
- As of now, Set 1: This looked the most simple and clear to me, showing the liquidating effect of the function on otherwise solid matter. I also liked the undulating lines which added movement and dimension to the icon. But I am still not too satisfied with any of the icons, will need to do more exploration.

![Share Dreamscape](/w04s2/w04s2_10.png)
*Share Dreamscape* 
- Description: This icon is a little different from "Change Dream Layer". This icon is more about linking the ecosystem of one persons' dream to the ecosystem of another persons' dream. It is a more collaborative format in some cases.
- I drew inspiration from venn diagrams and also links to create these icons.
Preferred iconography:
- set 2: I really liked how recognisable the link in the design is, while incorporating the "dream" aspect by making the links cloud-shaped. The lines are again, varying in thickness which adds dimension and personality to the design.
My one grouse is that I haven't found a way to incorporate the radial design signature into it yet.

![Run Time Limit](/w04s2/w04s2_11.png)
*Run Time Limit* 
- Description: Should the traveller need to complete a dream within a set amount of time in the real world, they can set a "run time", like a movie run time, to ensure punctual completion of the dream.
- I tried to look at the "time" icons and warning icons in a different way to fit these sets of icons.
Preferred iconography:
- set 2: I think this design was able to capture the idea of perimeters around time for the dream, with both the break in radial balance on 2a, and the section of the radial design highlighted in 2b.
- Darlings I had to kill: I found the design for set 3 while experimenting with the falling sand of the hourglass and was so thrilled I could incorporate the exclamation mark so discreetly... but I also realised it could look awkward and too abstract for the average viewer.

![Risk Factor](/w04s2/w04s2_12.png)
*Risk Factor* 
- Description: The assumption in this world I have created is that the traveller is lucid dreaming for most of the dreamscape manipulation. However, should the traveller wish to incorporate some unpredictability ie. risk to the dream, this function is able to do so, pulling arbituary things from the subconscious and randomsizing experiences.
- I took inspiration from warning signs and speed limit icons for these sets of icons.
Preferred iconography:
- set 3: I was very thrilled being able to incorporate the radial design signature, the speed limit look and an exclamation mark design in the same icon in a simple and straightforward way. The lines here are also varying in thickness so it remains within the same design language created, and adds interest.
