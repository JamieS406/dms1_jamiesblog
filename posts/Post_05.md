**A Brief Introduction:**
This film follows the thoughts, emotions and perspectives I have been experiencing coming into the program, and also coming to a new country. There are three main "Acts" that occur in the film. 
* **"Act 1"** portrays my excitement and apprehension with starting a new season of life. Scenes that figuritively show me starting a fresh page, being plugged into the system and experiencing a vibrant fast paced life are shown through L cuts of sound following through, match cuts and cutaway shots. 
* **"Act 2"** portrays my anxiety and feelings of being lost as I grapple with the unknown, experiencing loneliness and unfamiliarity. Carefully choreographed match cuts of full and closeup shots illustrate such feelings of fear and uncertainty. A transitional point before Act 3, purposefully the only shot where the camera angle moves in the whole film, shows a shift in my perspective that encourages me to enjoy the process. 
* **"Act 3"** subsequently shows how I realise learning is also about fully experiencing and appreciating every stage of growth, knowing that every little step counts, and that the journey matters more than the result. Ambient sounds timed carefully with J cuts are added to allow audiences to feel present in the moments I experienced and found wonder in. I tied the very last scene to the 5th scene in Act 1, to show my hope that one day, my flegling self will be able to find my wings in the program and soar to greater heights.

**The soundtrack was chosen due to several factors:** 
1. It effectively showed the intermingled excitement and apprehension I felt via chromatic harmonies
2. It had an ABA style thematic progression, meaning it had a starting theme, transitioned in the middle, and went back to the starting theme, but augmented. This would follow the narrative I envisioned (Act 1 positive, Act 2 apprehensive, Act 3 reflective). With the last thematic progression echoing the first, it gave greater nuance to the last scenes as it is familiar, yet layered with greater intentionality. 
3. It is able bring out many layers of emotion, yet it is simple, sincere and unpretentious in quality.
