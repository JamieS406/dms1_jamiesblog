# **Pen Tool Class exercises**
![Bezier Game](/w05s1/w05s1_Bgame.png)
*Bezier Game*
- As someone who is used to Illustrator having done graphic design work before, I quite enjoyed the Bezier game, and it was a good refresher on shape creation by linework instead of compound shapes. Instead of focussing on complete accuracy, I enjoyed the challenge of trying to get myself to create the given shape in the least amount of nodes instead. Definitely was harder! Accuracy is lower and you needed to angle the curves carefully to not exceed the shape template. Overall I think I didn't do too bad... but my competitiveness would have liked to have another go if time permitted ðŸ”¥

*EPRS*
- This exercise wasn't too hard, I just had to ensure I was careful around tricky bends like the "S" and the inner angles of the "R".

![Hopper exercise](/w05s1/w05s1_hopperexercise.png)
*Hopper Exercise*
- I'll admit I was pretty ambitious in picking and committing to the full tracing of this Hopper painting, including the highlights and shadows. Had to scrutinise and carefully place my points so that they line up nicely. Really brought me back to the pain-staking days of creating art just by mouse linework, as every digital artist can attest to. I'm still glad I managed to complete it though!

# **Assignment 2 Colour Scheme**
- Overall after discussing with my classmates on possible colour schemes, I decided perhaps an indigo would be an appropriate main colour to use. Indigo represents tranquility and also mystery, It is able to be deeply relaxing yet intriguingly unknown, which perfectly encapsulates the experience of dream travelling. I chose a more vibrant indigo, borrowing inspiration from the neon quality of sci-fi palettes. I also considered a secondary palette of blues and possibly an accent colour of orange/olive green.

![Gravity Colour](/w05s1/w05s1_01.png)
**Disable/Enable Gravity**
*Observations:*
- Olive green on blue seemed to disappear, not enough contrast.
- Orange on blue looked almost garish, let alone orange on purple.
- Need radial design to be dark enough to see from afar, but not so dark that it overpowers the circle + star.

*Preferred Colour Composition:*
- Set 8: If I squint to reduce my vision, I am still able to make out the direction that the icon is pointing. Additionally, I really like the slight gradient at the edge of the design as it lends a dreamy quality to the otherwise solid-looking design. 
- I frankly don't think more than 2 colours work with this set of icons as there are 2 main elements, the circle + star element and the radial design. Any more colours and unnecessary attention will be drawn to irrelevant parts of the icon.

![Reality Colour](/w05s1/w05s1_02.png)
**Reality Circuit Failsafe**
*Observations:*
- Radial design in the "dream state" eye must have very high contrast with white of eye, or else it disappears
- "Reality state" Iris with accent colour is a no-go - looks terrifying
- "Reality state" Iris cannot be extremely dark: too high contrast with the white of eye, looks like its separate from rest of the icon
- "Dream state" icon may not be able to handle full accent colour on white of eye in orange, but maybe olive green?

*Preferred Colour Composition:*
- Set 6: Putting an accent colour in the iris proved to look rather scary, so this set 6 keeps things balanced with 2 main hues in a gradient. 
- Set 8: Set 8 stands out the most out of the designs, but I do worry it has too high a contrast with the rest of the purple icons and look game-like instead.

![Change dream Colour](/w05s1/w05s1_03.png)
**Change Dream Layer**
*Observations:*
- Arrow has a tendency to disappear with any lighter colours. Will either need very dark colours or thicken lines, or both
- Arrow disappears if top circle is too dark. Will need middle-ground colours
- Radial design disappears with accent colour and light blues

*Preferred Colour Composition:*
- Set 11: This set has adequate contrast on the arrow above, still shows the radial design clearly and does not look garish. I would also consider Set 7's ratio of colours for the gradient.

![Risk Colour](/w05s1/w05s1_04.png)
**Risk Factor**
*Observations:*
- Need radial design to be dark enough to see from afar, but not overpowering the exclamation mark/pointer
- Exclamation mark design can accomodate even the darkest colours
- Accent colour may not work so well on this design

*Preferred Colour Composition:*
- Set 2 or 3: Nothing too crazy in terms of design, these 2 just look the most harmonious in terms of contrast and colour, while also having the gradient accent.

# **Assignment 2 Additional Progress**
![Time Progress](/w05s1/w05s1_05.png)
*Time Difference Calibration*
- I've tried exploring the design for Time Difference some more, and I quite like 3e and 3d, with the dark part being the selected realm (dream/reality) that one is checking.
- Will check with Thomas in class on thoughts.
