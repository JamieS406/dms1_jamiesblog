# **Greybox Prototyping**

*What am I doing oh dear...*
- Unfortunately at this stage I'm in a bit of a mental block. I know that I want the experience to be from a very claustrophobic to very wide and freeing sensation, but I realised making things feel "claustrophobic" in an experience is harder than I thought. Above is the very first prototype I created. On the left you can see I attempted to create a small box-like space in the "initial phase", and then open up. I do think it looks very awkward, though.

- The tree view looks roughly like this in this draft.

*Inspiration*
- I then tried sourcing for inspiration on "claustrophobia" online in architecture to see how others have shaped spaces to create such an emotion.

- I tested the "straight narrow tunnel" method that some of these inspiration images suggest, but as you can see from the draft shown previously it 1. Does not look very flattering, nor is it space conducive 2. It feels to straightforward a resolution, for lack of a better word. I felt the journey needed to be BOTH clautrophobic and confusing.

- However, this "straight tunnel route came with the discovery that little "cracks" in the ceiling or walls lets in light to the space. This gives the space a touch of interest and hope, yet ironically slices the space to make the tightness of the area even more apparent with the illumination.

- You can see here I am looking at the different angles of these light leaks, and considering how they are affecting the space.

- Thereafter, I tried more of the winding, angled tight spaces suggested in other inspiration images. I whipped up a quick tube-like prototype and found the "walking in circles" of the player is helping to give the effect of frustration I want to convey. With this bit of knowledge I went on to my next draft design.

![draft2](/w07s2/w07s2_draft_2.png)
- This was the next main draft I did. I imported a texture from a pot model as well to get an idea of how it could look like.
- I incorporated the "cracks" idea from the first draft as well, and it really made it feel more unsure of itself, as it affected how the outer structure looked too.
- as I was making it I realised it started to look like a cracked pot, and a maze. I think that really ties into the concept and it looks cool!!

![maze1](/w07s2/w07s2_maze_1.png)
- Here I tried creating the angled, small curving spaces. I think it looks pretty claustrophobic.

![maze2](/w07s2/w07s2_maze_2.png)
- I found in this prototype that there are some "dead end" deceptive nooks and spaces that seem to be trying to find their place. It almost looks like its trying to transition and morph as the player goes through the space, which works perfectly with my idea of trying to grow into myself.
