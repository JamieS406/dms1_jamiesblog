*Trying Figma Functions*
- Even though I've used Figma and the app Adobe XD (similar to Figma) before, it's been a while so it was very nice having this refresher to get back in the groove of web design. Here you can see I rediscovered the gradient options for colouring shapes.
- I also enjoyed playing with the opacity of the visuals I created (the cute little frog!) to make the illusion of depth.

*Prototyping + Figma Layers*
- One thing I learnt here that I previously forgot: things only show up on a "Frame" when they are categorised under the frame. So they must remain within the heirachy of the frame or else it won't show up, even if it's smack in the middle of the design visually. 
- In the prototyping stage of this website building, we linked elements "on click" to scroll to a point in the website which was useful. 
- HOWEVER it is also sorely disappointing to note that Figma has removed the functions to link variable states and some other basic prototyping functions from the "free" version.

*Hyperlinks*
- Another useful thing learnt: hyperlinks can be prototyped into text and images under the prototype components sections. Will have to remember that for linking my final products!
 
# **Assignment 4 Progress - Section Planning**

**Assignment 1 - Video Edit**
*The Idea*
- I chose to depict my emotions as I moved to Melbourne from my home country, Singapore. I wanted my film to feel like scenes caught in their tracks, with the small associations and revelations I log as part of this season of my life.

*Planning and brainstorm*
- Creating the overview of my film’s storyline and flow, I identified the main emotions within key sections. I also earmarked specific scenes that would need additional sound effects to enhance the emotion/concept I wanted to convey. This helped to give me a general framework to work with to look for soundtracks and sound effects. 

*Stylistic Choices*
- I used a montage-like, tableau style which was able to capture “stills” in time that I noticed. This gave a sentimental, genuine feeling, as if the viewer is going through an album of my memories with me and reliving the journey. I heavily utilized patterns, match cuts and symbolism, taking pains to draw meaning from associating one scene to another. These methods are simple to execute yet powerful in storytelling, allowing me to leverage the limitation on effects and transitions given in the assignment brief to my advantage.

*Storyboard Planning*
- For Storyboarding, the main emotions felt in the story became thematic arcs for 3 categories of emotion to find footage for: Excited, Anxious and Hopeful. This directly translated to how I built my video repository.

*Video Repository*
- I created a repository of relevant footage under 3 thematic categories that I could mix and match as I went along, which gave me creative freedom to get more opportunistic shots that catch my eye at a given time. 

*Sound Design*
- Sound can powerfully manipulate tone, to either enhance or subvert the visual information. An instance I leveraged on it was when I played around with carrying over the boiling sounds in the “Anxious” section of the work.

*Editing*
- Editing can direct the emphasis of the work appropriately throughout the work. In my edit, I divided the timing between my 3 main sections quite equally but gave a little more time to my “transitionary” section’s timing in the middle. This helped to emphasize the struggle I felt and how, emotionally and mentally, it felt longer and harder to figure out. 

**Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons**

*The Idea*
- Taking the topic “Dream”, this project imagines a world where dream-travel and manipulation has been made possible, much like the movie "Inception". The icons created are to navigate and manipulate the dreamscape effectively, with safeguards around the dream perimeters if the traveler so requires.

- I attached the concept of “Dream” to a movie with scenes and existing lore, which helped guide me in my design choices.

*But, Why? *
- This direction is novel enough for creative freedom. Yet, it is limited enough a scope as to give me proper boundaries for exploration: my icons are limited to functions to use within a dreamscape. Literally, a dream brief.

*Planning and Brainstorm*
- I iterated relentlessly throughout my process. Even ones that I thought were “good”, I tried to push it to “great”.
I first identified “dreamlike” iconography designs and continuously iterated: changing styles, shapes, proportions, contrast levels and orientations of the icons. My criteria when creating the icons was that it must have clarity, recognizability and cohesion. I continued iterating or began refining depending on whether the icons adhered to these criteria.

*Colour Choices*
- I decided on an analogous mixture of indigo and blue colours. Indigo represents tranquility and also mystery. It is able to be deeply relaxing yet intriguingly unknown, which perfectly encapsulates the experience of dream travelling. I chose a more vibrant indigo, borrowing inspiration from the neon quality of sci-fi palettes. Blue is a very relaxing colour and a good supporting colour for indigo.

- I limited myself to just these 2 main colours to create visual uniformity and cohesion. I also had an indigo-and-blue gradient feature within select icons as well, for visual interest.

*Sound Design*
- Understanding the dreamy, sci-fi theme in my icon set, I looked for sound effects that will not only correspond to the icon functions, but also have the dreamy/sci-fi genre of sound to them. This is to further create a sense of cohesion between the icons.

**Assignment 3 - Virtual Environment**
*The Idea*
- This 3D environment was created around the theme of “repotting”, a metaphor I used to represent my growth and journey in design.  From first being removed from the confines of my traditional academic structures to being literally uprooted from my home-country to expand my capabilities on foreign soil, my creative boundaries have been continually pushed beyond my comfort zones and my wildest imaginations.


*Prototyping*
- The concept was to journey from a place of claustrophobic confusion to a wide and freeing expanse. The “initial state” was to be a pot maze, and the “final state” on the tops of tree branches.
The prototyping process in grey-boxing was imperative. Early structural foundations could be envisioned with these rough plans. I was able to quickly realise things like a straight, narrow routes did not adequately deliver my creative intention of claustrophobia and confusion. This prompted me to try circular, more winding routes.

*Struggles: 2D vs 3D*
- In a two-dimensional space, I only had to check my alignments on 2 planes. In a three-dimensional environment, I can align things to the centre on one plane, and when I shift to a different angle, it becomes misaligned! 
- Three-dimensional environment design also means lighting and element proximity matters! 
- In the 3D environment can look very different in “play” mode than in editing mode. This difference in look means that I have to work harder to ensure the playthrough and my creative intention aligns.

*Sound Design*
- I used sound in my project to set the tone for each space, especially the “initial state” and the “final state” ambient music. This time, though, there was an added dimension of distance. Therefore, I also had to plan for how the proximity of the player affected certain sound effects, like going closer to the portal would make the glitter and ambient sound effects louder. This would prompt players to go closer to the portal and guide the player along.

*Space Planning and Cohesion*
- For cohesion, I ensured certain elements remained constant throughout the journey. For example, there was a constant presence of clouds and tree roots/branches, which had significant symbolism in the whole process. I also ensured that the environment had a relatively consistent colour palette of early browns/greens, and light blues + yellows.

*Play Testing Fun*
- I always found little bugs and happy accidents while play testing.
For bugs in my personal playthrough, I would find things like faulty stairs, incorrect sound effect spread and so much more.

- In getting others to play test my work, I found that people could climb my tree branches, fall off the edges of borders and even phase through my walls. This was very helpful to fix the errors I would otherwise have missed.

- I found some happy accidents as well, such as the big tree in the final state being visible through the translucent ceiling on the second floor.

# **Assignment 3 Progress - Moodboard + Layout**
**Moodboard**
![w10s2_moodboard](/w10s2/w10s2_moodboard.png)
*Assignment 3 Moodboard*
- I wanted my website to not be overtly busy, have a consistent branding throughout yet be able to convey a sense of play and delight. These inspirations above helped me structure some design choices I will be implementing into my preliminary designs.
