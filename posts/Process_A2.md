# **Assignment 2 Progress**
![Material Fluidity Icon Progress](/process_a2/matter_prog.png)
*Material Fluidity Icon Progress*
- After some discussion with Thomas I was inspired by the suggestion to look at material fluidity and the radial design like a portal of sorts for the change of states. Finally worked through this icon!

![Overview](/process_a2/bw_all.png)
*Overview of icons before colour palette*
- I felt it was important to lay out all the refined versions of the icons out, to:
1. To see if the iconography set looks cohesive and from the same family
2. To assess the level of contrast across the icons and adjust so that they are comfortable to the eye as a whole
3. Ensure that the icons are sufficiently different from each other to prevent confusion and preserve the uniqueness of each icon.
- After some adjusting, I think they look pretty good together. A little worried about the Time Limit icon and the Gravity icon, I will have to ensure they are far apart enough on the webpage, and make the colours a little more distinct. Possibly the Perspective icon and the Risk Factor icon could also be confused, so I shall also have to look out for that.

![Grid](/process_a2/grid_1.png)
*Formatting Icons into standard grid*
- For uniformity, I formatted all the icons inte square grids. This ensures that each icon is bound in specific dimensions, which will aid in spacing and sizing issues further down the road.

*Website format issue*
- Here, because I did not export my images as SVG files and did not bind my vectors to the square grid, the icons warped and had a white background when I uploaded them onto the website. To mitigate this, I exported all my icons within a transparent square that I created within my grid formatting and reexported everything in SVG files.

![BW](/process_a2/bw_colourp.png)
*Dark and Light Mode testing*
- To assess which background would make the icons shine, I created separate colour palettes for light and dark mode for the whole iconography set. Turns out it looks much cooler in dark mode and also fits the theme of "dream" much more, so I shall be creating a dark background for my website.

![Config](/process_a2/config_1.png)
*Configuration*
- The configuration of icons affects balance, coherence and visual appeal. Thus, I took the extra step to plan out how I would configure the icons on the webpage in the stipulated 3x3 format. I decided on the bottom right, and as you can see I have drawn coloured lines to show the logic of the placement.
1. Yellow Line: visually dense pointing up (gravity icon) to visually dense pointing down (layers icon). Thus complementary
2. Green Line: both symmetrically balanced icons, central star for both icons. Thus balanced
3. Red Line: Visually dense, very circular icons, similar shape. Therefore must be far apart, but balancing each other
4. Blue line: Eye (Reality icon) is most centralised and visually heavy icon. To balance overall composition it must be placed in the centre. Is complemented by two visually lighter icons on either side.

**Sound Design Considerations**
*Gravity sound Design*
- Wanted it to have an audible weight/body to the sound with an almost suction-like quality. The force of gravity fundamentally affects the behavior of anything with mass, and I wanted that to be almost tangible through the sound design. I did not like the crunch and intense base of the original soundbite so I had to manipulate it to create the desired effect.

*Perspective Change Sound Design*
- Changing perspectives is almost like teleporting to another “location” in the narrative, and I wanted to capture that feeling of body switching. This sound has a fantasy-like twinkle with a digital quality to it, which ties it back neatly with the sci-fi quality of the other icons.

*Time Difference Calibration Sound Design*
- Among all the time-based icons, I wanted this icon to sound the most like the quintessential clock-tick sound. However, I decided against getting a tick-tick sound that was too analog as it would deviate from the sci-fi digital sound. So I opted for a more muted, clean ticking sound, that also had some musicality and syncopation to add interest.

*Material Fluidity Calibration Sound Design*
- There was 2 ways of approaching this icons’ sound; either a very liquid-like sound, or a very heavy, gravelly sound. I originally tried a liquid-like warble, but after leaving it for a while and coming back to it, the sound unfortunately reminded me of a toilet flush, and I couldn’t unhear it. If I could have that association so could someone else, and that would be a rather unfortunate experience. So I instead opted for a weightier sound in motion, which I think translates the idea of material fluidity quite well with less room for misinterpretation.

*Reality Failsafe Sound Design*
- I wanted the sound to mimic the feeling of waking up, almost like an auditory opening of the eyes. Waking up has a slight feeling of falling as well: back into reality as reality opens back up to you, so the little “puff” sound that accompanied the bright opening sound really captured that feeling.

*Risk Factor Sound Design*
- I wanted it to sound urgent, yet not terrifying. It should evoke the idea of enabling the unknown and possibly unpredictable (ie. Risky), but also thematically tie in with the slightly sci-fi, dream-like sound qualities of the rest of the iconography set. 

*Run Time Limit Sound Design*
- I wanted it to sound like a clock alarm, without it sounding too much like either the Dream/Reality Time or Risk Factor icons. This sounded appropriately alarm-like while not being excessively alarming or too much like a clock. The muted, digital sound also helped to meld with the other icons as a set.

*Share Dreamscape Sound Design*
- Sharing dreams is almost like linking/locking two dreamscapes together, so I wanted the sound to be like a click of a lock/two puzzle pieces clicking together.

*Change Dream Layer Sound Design*
- Moving through different dream layers gives the impression of flying through to a different realm and settling in it. I wanted there to be a space-ship “lift-off” quality to the sound with a little resistance near the end to indicate the arrival to the next “dream layer”. 

**Final Reflections**
- This assignment was quite the enjoyable experience for me. I had a lot more creative freedom to design whatever I wished, using the fullest of my artistic sensibilities for the task,as compared to the caveats one must factor in for clients. A real dream to work on (pun fully intended). 
- The main learning areas for me was in coding the website and sound design. 
1. Coding: Coding is a mountain I am still trying hard to scale. I'm beginning to understand the mechanics of basic html, though I definitely feel I have a long, long way to go. Was very satisfying when I managed to make the interactions work after Thomas' guidance though!
2. Sound: I've never really worked with sound in the heavily visual world of graphic design, but it certainly is a dimension that enhances the overall user experience, being cognisant that audiences process multiple senses at once, not just visuals. Trying my hand at sound design has made me more sensitive to things like volume, pitch, fade-ins/outs, anticipated timings, sound quality and the visceral emotions/reactions associated with certain sounds. I believe its allowing me to be a more thoughtful and effective designer, and I hope to keep improving on my design sensibilities in all its dimensions.
