# **Assignment 2 Progress**

*Material Fluidity Icon Progress*
- After some discussion with Thomas I was inspired by the suggestion to look at material fluidity and the radial design like a portal of sorts for the change of states. Finally worked through this icon!

![Overview](/process_a2/bw_all.png)
*Overview of icons before colour palette*
- I felt it was important to lay out all the refined versions of the icons out, to:
1. To see if the iconography set looks cohesive and from the same family
2. To assess the level of contrast across the icons and adjust so that they are comfortable to the eye as a whole
3. Ensure that the icons are sufficiently different from each other to prevent confusion and preserve the uniqueness of each icon.
- After some adjusting, I think they look pretty good together. A little worried about the Time Limit icon and the Gravity icon, I will have to ensure they are far apart enough on the webpage, and make the colours a little more distinct. Possibly the Perspective icon and the Risk Factor icon could also be confused, so I shall also have to look out for that.

*Formatting Icons into standard grid*
- For uniformity, I formatted all the icons inte square grids. This ensures that each icon is bound in specific dimensions, which will aid in spacing and sizing issues further down the road.

*Website format issue*
- Here, because I did not export my images as SVG files and did not bind my vectors to the square grid, the icons warped and had a white background when I uploaded them onto the website. To mitigate this, I exported all my icons within a transparent square that I created within my grid formatting and reexported everything in SVG files.

*Dark and Light Mode testing*
- To assess which background would make the icons shine, I created separate colour palettes for light and dark mode for the whole iconography set. Turns out it looks much cooler in dark mode and also fits the theme of "dream" much more, so I shall be creating a dark background for my website.

![Config](/process_a2/bw_colourp.png)
*Configuration*
- The configuration of icons affects balance, coherence and visual appeal. Thus, I took the extra step to plan out how I would configure the icons on the webpage in the stipulated 3x3 format. I decided on the bottom right, and as you can see I have drawn coloured lines to show the logic of the placement.
1. Yellow Line: visually dense pointing up (gravity icon) to visually dense pointing down (layers icon). Thus complementary
2. Green Line: both symmetrically balanced icons, central star for both icons. Thus balanced
3. Red Line: Visually dense, very circular icons, similar shape. Therefore must be far apart, but balancing each other
4. Blue line: Eye (Reality icon) is most centralised and visually heavy icon. To balance overall composition it must be placed in the centre. Is complemented by two visually lighter icons on either side.
