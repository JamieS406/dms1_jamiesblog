With the help of 2 lovely deskmates I had a collective 3 pieces of footage I could play with. However, since they are so wildly unrelated the first problem was to make them make sense.

![Inspiration!](/w01s2/w01s2_s1.png)
There is a parallel in the scene!! I can possibly try a matchbox cut with this.

![Inadequacy](/w01s2/w01s2_s2.png)
Oh my goodness, I suck at this so bad‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt even know how to zoom into this part to attempt my matchbox cut

![Attempt at Match Cut](/w01s2/w01s2_s3.png)
The aim of this is to now position the white chair from the previous scene to line up perfectly with the angle and size of the sofa.

![Different interface, incompatible skills](/w01s2/w01s2_s4.png)
Having learnt After Effects in the past, usually I ‚Äúdissolved‚Äù frames into each other by manipulating the opacity and keyframes. However, when I applied that same method to Premiere Pro it did not seem to work. Here you can see my keyframes nicely lined up, but it rudely cuts to the next scene without my intended dissolve effect. Bummer.

Okay, there is another lineup match cut we can do of the road and the forest room. We will need to tweak the angle and the framing but we can make this work? Perhaps bringing the scene back at the end to the forest room (Chai's Video) might be good?

![Stumped again](/w01s2/w01s2_s6.png)
After looking at the scene I DID feel a disconnect of logic. I wanted to line up the plant on the right of Chai‚Äôs video with the tree in mine, but something didn‚Äôt feel right. Here you can see I am trying to line up the roof line with the floor line of my road video to add more correlation.

![Lining up attempt 3](/w01s2/w01s2_s7.png)
Need to find a good transition cut to the sofa room. Try lining up the leading lines in the road video?

![Getting a feel of pacing](/w01s2/w01s2_s8.png)
Removing a significant amount of time out of Chai‚Äôs video. I realized unspoken ‚Äúpatience‚Äù of waiting at one scene is approximately 3 seconds before the viewer starts wondering if something went wrong. I found introducing the audio of the next clip before the scene starts helps prime the viewer for an incoming new scene, here at the 4 second mark.

![Supplementary learning, freeze frames](/w01s2/w01s2_s9.png)
I also learnt how to create a freeze segment to further accentuate the correlation between the roof of the patio with the roofing of the roadside building, the tree and the pillar, as well as the road and the patio floor. I extended that for a full second, as I realized the default 0.25 seconds was not enough for the mind to register a new scene or make sufficient relation to the next scene.

![Supplementary learning, audio sound levels](/w01s2/w01s2_s10.png)
Learned how to change audio sound levels! Finally can manipulate that.

![Failed attempt at another type of shot taught](/w01s2/w01s2_s11.png)
Tried to have a cutaway shot of the first scene again, but it just didn‚Äôt gel well. So I removed that.

![Ewwww video quality is wack](/w01s2/w01s2_s12.png)
Exported it out and the video quality is HORRENDOUS. Time to re-edit...Exported out on full screen, still varying quality of video :‚Äô00

Reflection:
Overall honestly I don‚Äôt think I did an amazing job even though I really did sincerely try‚Ä¶ I can see so many areas in the video where I just wish frames will line up better, timing was better, context building was cleaner, etc. And I would have liked to fix the video resolution problem‚Ä¶but it seemed the source files were already varied quality. Even though I managed to get some juxtaposition in the colours and scene, my artistic eye just feels like it isn‚Äôt good enough to be something I am proud of, yet. Then again, I am completely fresh to this video editor, so I cannot expect masterpieces immediately. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll improve with more practice, but for now, an acceptable video.
