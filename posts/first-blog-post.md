One of the most difficult of the items to find, this elusive coffee joint had running in circles, mistaking it for other cafes, and staring at each other in disbelief. Seriously, it shouldn't have been that hard...but it was.

Since this book could possibly be one of a few sections, we looked at 3 sections for where this could be: Arts, Technology or Technology and Communication. We bet on the last section, and tried to get as many books about Digital Media as we could into the frame. We're betting on 4 books...we hope at least one meets the criteria. 1 in 4 chance?

We found this quick and easy! Since we were at the library to find the Digital Media book, we looked out the window and saw the pretty paper net cascading down. A satisfyingly simple find ðŸ˜Š
