I must say I'm rather pleased at the reception for my video, everyone was very kind and helpful with their comments!

**Parts I did well included:**
1. Good use of metaphorical storytelling, ability to convey both message and personality
2. Appropriate choice of soundtrack
3. Good use of diagetic and non-diagetic sound

**I did get several comments on improvements with regards to:**
1. More L and J cuts
2. Increasing of ambient sound and decreasing of soundtrack for some parts
3. Pacing of cuts for some shots

After taking these into consideration, I decided to make some tweaks in volume for some scenes such as the scribbling sounds in the crumpled paper scene. I also decided to carry over the emotions "boiling under the surface" into the rest of Act 2, by having a low-drone sound that is akin to the boiling water sound effect bubbling below the soundtrack.
I also tweaked the sound effects in Act 3 to make the J cuts I was trying to execute more obvious. I mostly left the pacing alone, as I felt some scenes required more time to be pondered upon, especially Act 2, since most of Act 1 and Act 3 is quick cutting from one scene to another.
