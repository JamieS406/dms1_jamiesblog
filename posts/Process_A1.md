Here are several screenshots of key moments in my process that I learned new things and added more techniques! I decided to create a dedicated post with the shots I collected during production apart from the homework posts, as a feature post so that it is neater and clearer to watch the process.

**Changing of pitch**

In an early stage of editing, I realised I required a note to be raised and prolonged to get the pacing I desired. I had to figure out how to change it, and relied on my ear to get just the right pitch. Thank goodness my music education came in handy.

**Sound quality issues**

1. The original sound of the video had way too much feedback. Though realistic, it would cause too much inteference with the soundtrack. Even after trying to lower the gain, it sounded abysmal.
2. Without the real-time sound, I attempted to find boiling water sounds similar to that of water in a small metal pot. I never realised how different boiling water can sound in different vessels until I searched up the boiling water sound effects.
Sidenote: I realised also that the abrupt throwing sound of the next scene - throwing crumpled paper - would have been alarming if it introduced itself right on the transition, so I made use of a J-cut to introduce the crumpling paper sounds before the throwing on the actual transition, as a more natural carrying-into of the next scene.

**Learning foley and camera angles!**

This was one of the most interesting scenes to shoot personally! I learnt several things from this:
1. This shot had to be choreographed carefully. The angle of the camera had to angle the crumpled paper at the same position as the boiling water bubbles of the previous scene, while including enough room above the paper to catch the crumpled ball flying past, and accomodate the sketchbook I will be scribbling on.
2. Sound foley! As I couldn't bear to tear my actual sketchbook paper, especially as I anticipated several takes before getting it right, I used a flier I had on hand to create the tearing sounds. I also used a crumpled piece of cardboard instead of stiff sketchbook paper for a heavier sound that will catch better on audio.
3. I realised the angle at which gestures enter a scene can create different connotations! When my hand covered my drawing hand from the top of the screen to within the frame, it appeared like I was comforting myself. When it entered from right to left in the same plane as my drawing hand, it looked as though someone else was comforting me. They were both my hands, but its interesting how much more natural the first gesture looked as from the same person, compared to the second!

**Matching up shots**

ThoughI used the same camera - my phone - in all the shots, some shots were clearer and higher quality than others, which made match cuts at times difficult. In the ideal world I would be able to zoom in and line everything perfectly with no quality drop, but I guess it couldn't be helped. I troubleshooted this by instead manipulating on the higher quality videos, creating less discrepancy and cleaner shots.
PS: This shot has the same flower as the crumpled paper shot, but when it was fresh! This was on purpose of course.

**Creating similarity in juxtapositions**
