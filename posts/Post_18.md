# **Class Exercise: Grids**

- *Grids*
- We tried our hand at grids, and explored how websites used grids to create a system throughout their site.
- Pinterest was relatively easy to fit neatly into grids, but I really struggled with Youtube for some reason. The elements just didn't seem to want to sit in any position, not conforming to the rules it creates for itself. Perhaps I'm using the wrong column thickness, or the wrong gutter width? I don't know, but this was the best I could do.

- *Menu bar troubleshooting*
- In my previous design, I wanted to incorporate a little icon on the left top corner of the fixed menu bar, but the Figma user interface kept getting in the way of my menu bar. You can see here I accomodated for the menu UI by shifting my menu downwards... but it creates this awkward gap that you can see in the second image. 
- To try to solve this, I've attempted a thicker menu bar.

- *Extending visual identity*
- In trying to extend the visual identity created in the front of my website, I attempted pulling out the letter-shapes and making them headers for the project numbers.

- *Imposing Grids*
- I've chosen a 24-column grid system, 2 times the standard amount,just so I can have a little more flexibility in where I'm able to park my elements within the space given.

- *Playing with letter-shape treatment*
- I've also experiemented with having a negative of the letter-shape form I've created, while having the solid shape as a supporting colour element. So far, I'm really liking the effect because I can see how I can translate this into a stylistic signature for the rest of the website.

![w11s2_layout1](/w11s2/w11s2_layout1.jpg)
- *Gradient stylistic addition*
- I'm attempting a subtle gradient on the background to add dimension to the otehrwise flat background design, for visual interest.
- I've also translated that, to varying levels of success, in my images and borders. Will keep playing with it.

- *Re-doing my layouts*
- I attempted to lay my images out in the grid format I had originally set out for, but it REALLY didn't look good. Everything looked crowded, tiny, and overwhelming. If the images were like this, what more when I have to put in my explanations?
- So I went back to the drawing board and attempted something that showcased mainly the images in the form of gifs when clicked, and tried my utmost to reduce the number of words shown in 1 block at any point in time.

![w11s2_slideshow1](/w11s2/w11s2_slideshow1.jpg)
- I also tried to take advantage of the single-scroll format instead of letting it be an obstacle, by spacing out sections, putting less elements in a visual space at any one point, and breadcrumbing the viewer with guiding arrows so that the experience is a lot more enjoyable and engaging.
__________
![w11s2_staridentity](/w11s2/w11s2_staridentity.jpg)
- *Star visual element as part of identity*
- While Experimenting with elements to add in, I had the idea to have constellation circles around each main project header, and increase the number of stars for every number (as shown). Will see if it works, and more importantly, if it can be properly extended out to be incorporated into the larger visual identity.
