snippet: Fleshing out and reorganising storyboards
---
Combining the narrative I've outlined with the scenes I am envisioning, I reorgainsed and rewrote my storyboard to create greater clarity in focus and significance of each sections' scenes.

After going through class yesterday about the effects of sound on thematic emphasis and eliciting emotional reaction, I decided to go back in to my reworked storyboard, this time with added attention to how I could craft my sound design more intentionally. Based on my scenes, I know there are several scenes that could work to have sound increase: the baby bird chirping (innocence and new-ness), fizz sound (excitement), boiling water (frustration), crumpling paper and sighing (also frustration), some train sounds (materialisation of world), and bird chirping on take-off (create emphasis on excitement for future).

Since this sound design concept is relatively new to me, I'm excited to try to incorporate more of what I learnt into my work. There is Materialisation, Diagetic/Non-diagetic sound, Synchresis, Misattribution, volitional/reactive attention.
