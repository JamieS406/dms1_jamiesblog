I reworked my overarching direction and key ideas, formulating them into scene blocks for ease of pacing. 
Here is the scene explanation breakdown - progression is as labelled - and what I will be using to create my final assignment 1 video.

After going through class yesterday about the effects of sound on thematic emphasis and eliciting emotional reaction, I decided to go back in to my reworked storyboard, this time with added attention to how I could craft my sound design more intentionally. Based on my scenes, I know there are several scenes that could work to have sound increase: the baby bird chirping (innocence and new-ness), fizz sound (excitement), boiling water (frustration), crumpling paper and sighing (also frustration), some train sounds (materialisation of world), and bird chirping on take-off (create emphasis on excitement for future).

Since this sound design concept is relatively new to me, I'm excited to try to incorporate more of what I learnt into my work. There is Materialisation, Diagetic/Non-diagetic sound, Synchresis, Misattribution, volitional/reactive attention.

Combining the narrative I've outlined with the scenes I am envisioning, I reorgainsed and rewrote my storyboard to create greater clarity in focus and significance of each sections' scenes. The storyboard numbers are colour coded according to the corresponding sections as the scene progression breakdown above.

I wanted it such that section 1 would have some ambient noise, main part of section 2 will have no ambient sound, and section 3 will have the most ambient sound.
Doing this shows how in section 1 I am interacting cautiously with my new environment, section 2 I am stressed and worried so the sound almost "numbs out", and section 3 I am embracing the new environment, being more present in situations and learning to more intentionally find wonder in everything I see.
