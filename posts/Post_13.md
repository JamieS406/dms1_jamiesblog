# **Unity Sound Progress**

*Symbolism and item sounds*
- A theme I wanted to carry through in the environment was the "tree of dreams", a metaphorical representation of my creative growth and my "dreams" growing. This was shown through a tree growing clouds: in the first state it is small and stunted, a bonzai, only a fraction of what it was meant to become. I experimented with having a "twinkle" sound attached to any area with parts of the cloud tree present in a scene, increasing in volume and permeating the area as its growth spreads.  However I realised in the maze perhaps it interfered too much with the ambient noise. Will have to play with volume and maximum distance for this.

*Maze Sound*
- A challenge I faced with sound was that the maze layer (level 1) and the transitional area (level 2) very in close proximity, yet I wanted the ambient music of each layer to remain more or less separate. After some trial and error I've manipulated the maximum distance to be smaller and for the ambient sound source to be the innermost walls of the maze section.

*Level 2 Sound*
- In tandem with the maze sound, I've experimented having the "twinkle" sound and the final state's ambient sound around the portal in the centre of the room, suggesting to and inviting the player to stand on the platform to be advanced to the final state.

*Maze plan*
- I mapped out a route for the maze, created in Illustrator and imported onto Unity. I figured this would work best compared to blindly building up the maze with no plan. It also helped greatly in making sure the maze remained circular as i built imported broken pot tiles piece-by-piece into the maze shape.

*Maze plan - spacing*
- The maze floorplan helped a lot in gauging the width required for the maze, and visualising the walk-through experience prior to building everything up.
