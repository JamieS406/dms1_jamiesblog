# **Assignment 3 Progress: Defining the Experience**
- I have begun to try to define what the "player's" point of view (POV) is with regards to this entire metaphor. 
- The player's POV is the various stages of a plant's growth journey. 

1. *Initial state (maze section):*
- When in the "maze", the player's POV would mimic the movement of the roots of a plant in a too-small pot, circling the area, finding cracks, trying to move beyond ones' confines.

2. *Transitional state (upper room section):*
- The player's POV is like a seedling breaking the surface of the soil, seeing light after the darkness and expanding one's horizons.

3. *Final state (top of tree section):*
- The player's POV is like the top-most leaves of a majestic tree, soaring above the clouds, with the sky open to enjoy and grow into.
