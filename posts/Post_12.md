# **Unity Class Exercises**
![Pier](/w08s1/w08s1_p.png)
- For class exercises we created a "pier" scene, and looked at how something might look lined up but look very different in 3D space.

- I played with this idea and created an arrangement that made it look like a pot was unbroken or "whole", but when you change the perspective or angle, you can see the pot pieces are all separated.



# **Assignment 3 Progress**
**Defining the Experience**
- I have begun to try to define what the "player's" point of view (POV) is with regards to this entire metaphor. 
- The player's POV is the various stages of a plant's growth journey. 

1. *Initial state (maze section):*
- When in the "maze", the player's POV would mimic the movement of the roots of a plant in a too-small pot, circling the area, finding cracks, trying to move beyond ones' confines.

2. *Transitional state (upper room section):*
- The player's POV is like a seedling breaking the surface of the soil, seeing light after the darkness and expanding one's horizons.

3. *Final state (top of tree section):*
- The player's POV is like the top-most leaves of a majestic tree, soaring above the clouds, with the sky open to enjoy and grow into.

**Things I'm Learning**

*Warping shapes*
- While combing through the LinkedIn tutorials to help myself along on the learning and building process, I found that probuilder can give you quite a lot of manipulation for cubes and shapes, allowing me to create these interesting obtuse forms and abstracted curved edges

*Probuilder Controls*
- The controls in the scene have an edge tool, a point tool, a whole side tool and a dimension (length breadth height) tool, which is making things easier.

*Stairs Test*
- I know there is a limitation on the "Character Controller" package created for our 3D environment, but after some testing I made the discovery the character can climb small steps. This means I can create a climbable staircase without needing to encode anything special into my program, which is great news for me ðŸ˜…

![Animation](/w08s1/w08s1_animation.png)
*Animation Lessons*
- The animation function looks really interesting! But I am kind of worried that it will "loop" back, when I want something to simply move and remain in the final state. Will have to test it.

![Audio](/w08s1/w08s1_audiolesson.png)
*Audio Lessons*
- I've also been trying out the audio functions by checking the lessons on LinkedIn, and will be sourcing for different ambient sountracks and item sounds. Its really exciting!
