**Black Squares Exercise:**
![Overview](/w04s1/w04s1_overview_2.png)
This is an overview of my complete exploration for the black squares activity! I had a lot of fun being challenged by the 4 black square limitation. Really brings out the improvisation and creativity muscle!~
Since the target audience of the icons are not defined, I held the assumption for the final choice of icon, that the icons should be immediately recognisable as if the viewer has had no prompting on what each icon should be. 

*Order* : I wanted it to look like scales, as in Law and Order with the scales of justice.
*Increase* : I felt this design was one of the more interesting ones, increasing not just in size but also proximity to each other. The asymmetrical balance juxtaposed to the symmetry of "Order" also felt interesting to me.
*Bold* : I used the typographical definition of "Bold" here. I wanted to challenge myself to make a bold letter with just 4 squares, and I think my zoomed-in "A" here looked pretty bold!
*Congested*: I wanted to show the cluttered, uncomfortable and overwhelming idea of congestion, and so I chose this design where the top-right square is purposefully jammed into a corner in a poorly fitting way.
*Tension*: All of the designs in tension were personal favourites, all depicting a scene of some sort. I personally felt this design was able to capture the drama of the small and vulnerable against the large and menacing, showing the tension in the scene right before the menacing figure strikes.
*Playful*: Though the stereotypical design for "Play" would be more scattered, I felt it more interesting depicting the 4 squares as a quirky character with personality, tilted to the side and ready for fun.

I mentally started out with definitions of each of the words. Some, like "Increase", was singular in meaning. However, others like "Bold" could have multiple meanings. For example, "Bold" could mean typographical boldened font, personality boldness, or just to mean a more overall louder design. These with multiple interpretations were more interesting to explore!

In order to keep my creative juices flowing, I jumped from one theme to another. If, while playing around with the squares, I found the prototype more suitable if adapted for another theme, I adapted it and transferred it to the other theme. This can be seen from one of the  lego -looking shapes I created for "Order" which in turn informed a ‚ÄúPlayful‚Äù icon down the line.

![For the brief!](/w04s1/w04s1_03.png)
In empathising with the target audience and "throwing away my darlings", I had to sacrifice designs I preferred for those that would be more recognisable for a general audience.
A prime example would be several of my ‚ÄúPlayful‚Äù categorys‚Äô  icons. 
1. I created a hot air balloon sailing over mountains (Top left corner) and I was frankly very proud that I could make that with just 4 squares. But I knew it could be interpreted instead as ‚Äútravel‚Äù or ‚Äúcarefree‚Äù. The ‚Äúread‚Äù was simply not singular enough.
2. I also managed to create a clown face (Bottom right corner. Negative space is the face, largest square is the mouth), but it is truly an obscure design that most people will not register at first glance. So again, I had to scrap that image.

![Using techniques](/w04s1/w04s1_04.png)
I used the "Alignment" tools to centralise my work, and also used "Transform" tools to tilt my squares at perfect 45-degree angles instead of manually turning my squares for some of my designs.

Overall, this exercise was a fun and stimulating one that I thoroughly enjoyed üòÜ

**Assignment 2 Brainstorming**

In order to create as many possibilities as I could during this preliminary stage, I explored several concepts and created mindmaps for each of them. I have found this method of ideation useful for me in this exercise, as even if I am unable to think of multiple ideas on 1 concept, I can subconsciously improve an idea for a different concept, adding a "randomised" element to my brainstorming session.
![Overview brainstorm assignment 2](/w04s1/w04s1_A2_Brainstorming.jpg)
This is the overview of all the concepts + ideas I explored. You can see as I brainstormed, I added critiques in orange and black, for the pros and cons respectively of each idea. I added synonyms and/or definitions of each of the concept titles in order to suggest different perspectives of the same concept to myself.

![Movement brainstorm](/w04s1/w04s1_movement.png)
*Concept*: This first concept gave me the idea: "what if there was traffic that needed to travel in a 3D axis instead of just forward, backward, left and right?" This was primarily from the idea of sci-fi spacecraft travel, and how traffic signs might look in those hypothetical situations. 
*Platform to use* : This would probably be sign-post user-interface that would have minimal responsive-state difference. A prime example would be the green man moving at a pedestrian crossing.
*Pros* : This idea could make for interesting 3-axis isometric designs not seen before in traffic signs. There could also be a lot of room for different variations of signs.
*Cons*: The limitation of responsive-state transitions.

![Future brainstorm](/w04s1/w04s1_future.png)
*Concept*:Imagining the control panel for the Star Wars X-wing fighter, especially for things like "Jump to Hyperspace" or "Droid Deploy".
*Platform to use*: An equivalent of a touch-screen phone would suffice
*Pros*: Exciting for me as I am a big Star Wars fan, also many opportunities for variation.
*Cons*: Could be very on-the-nose and limit is scope. Is it also a little too nerdy, I am not sure.
(I disregarded the second idea here as I could not come up with unique ideas for icons in the simulation)

![Dream brainstorm](/w04s1/w04s1_dream.png)
*Concept*: In movies like "Paprika" and "Inception", players enter a dreamscape and are able to manipulate + interact with their environment. I wanted to imagine how the "controls" of such an endeavour will be like.
*Platform to use*: An equivalent of a touch-screen phone/website will work.
*Pros*: One of the most interesting in terms of innovating new icons, and isometric designs can be incorporated with more silhouetted designs as well! 
*Cons*: Worried that dreamscapes are overdone and would thus not be very innovative.

![Climate brainstorm](/w04s1/w04s1_climate.png)
1. *Concept*: Creating icons for a sci-fi weather forecast, where intergalactic phenomena are framed as weather climates. These could include Comet snowfall, strong solar winds, milky-way cloud cover etc.
*Platform to use*: I wanted it to stimulate the forecasting on weather apps, so on a television screen/website screen or similar.
*Pros*: Can make for interesting adaptations on how current weather icons are portrayed in the news to create a sense of familiarity yet intrigue.
*Cons*: They still need to be recognisable.

2. *Concept*: Creating icons for a fantasy weather forecast, where weather conditions created/influenced by the "magic" of the world create interesting and unusual climates. The goal is to also frame it as a "regular weather forecast" for the citizens of that world.
*Platform to use*: I wanted it to stimulate the forecasting on weather apps, so on a television screen/website screen or similar.
*Pros*: Can make for interesting adaptations on how current weather icons are portrayed in the news to create a sense of familiarity yet intrigue. I can create as many strange and wonderful weather phenomena as my imagination can give. I can also draw on existing Dungeons and Dragons climates, so there is a wealth of scenarios I can research there!
*Cons*: They have to be recognisable to the players.

For "Legacy" and "Memory" which I did explore, although they did not become fleshed out concepts, "Legacy's" brainstorm inspired "Climate's" concept, and "Memory's" brainstorm inspired "Dream's" concept,so the ideas were still incorporated and enhanced!
