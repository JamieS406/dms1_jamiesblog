**Black Squares Exercise:**
![Overview](/w04s1/w04s1_overview_2.png)
This is an overview of my complete exploration for the black squares activity! I had a lot of fun being challenged by the 4 black square limitation. Really brings out the improvisation and creativity muscle!~
*Order* : I wanted it to look like scales, as in Law and Order with the scales of justice.
*Increase* : I felt this design was one of the more interesting ones, increasing not just in size but also proximity to each other. The asymmetrical balance juxtaposed to the symmetry of "Order" also felt interesting to me.
*Bold* : I used the typographical definition of "Bold" here. I wanted to challenge myself to make a bold letter with just 4 squares, and I think my zoomed-in "A" here looked pretty bold!
*Congested*: I wanted to show the cluttered, uncomfortable and overwhelming idea of congestion, and so I chose this design where the top-right square is purposefully jammed into a corner in a poorly fitting way.
*Tension*: All of the designs in tension were personal favourites, all depicting a scene of some sort. I personally felt this design was able to capture the drama of the small and vulnerable against the large and menacing, showing the tension in the scene right before the menacing figure strikes.
*Playful*: Though the stereotypical design for "Play" would be more scattered, I felt it more interesting depicting the 4 squares as a quirky character with personality, tilted to the side and ready for fun.


I mentally started out with definitions of each of the words. Some, like "Increase", was singular in meaning. However, others like "Bold" could have multiple meanings. For example, "Bold" could mean typographical boldened font, personality boldness, or just to mean a more overall louder design. These with multiple interpretations were more interesting to explore!

In order to keep my creative juices flowing, I jumped from one theme to another. If, while playing around with the squares, I found the prototype more suitable if adapted for another theme, I adapted it and transferred it to the other theme. This can be seen from one of the  lego -looking shapes I created for "Order" which in turn informed a “Playful” icon down the line.

![For the brief!](/w04s1/w04s1_03.png)
In empathising with the target audience and "throwing away my darlings", I had to sacrifice designs I preferred for those that would be more recognisable for a general audience.
A prime example would be several of my “Playful” categorys’  icons. 
1. I created a hot air balloon sailing over mountains (Top left corner) and I was frankly very proud that I could make that with just 4 squares. But I knew it could be interpreted instead as “travel” or “carefree”. The “read” was simply not singular enough.
2. I also managed to create a clown face (Bottom right corner. Negative space is the face, largest square is the mouth), but it is truly an obscure design that most people will not register at first glance. So again, I had to scrap that image.

![Using techniques](/w04s1/w04s1_04.png)
I used the "Alignment" tools to centralise my work, and also used "Transform" tools to tilt my squares at perfect 45-degree angles instead of manually turning my squares for some of my designs.



Since the target audience of the icons are not defined, I held the assumption for the final choice of icon, that the icons should be immediately recognisable as if the viewer has had no prompting on what each icon should be.
