**Black Squares Exercise:**
![Overview](/w04s1/w04s1_overview_2.png)
This is an overview of my complete exploration for the black squares activity! I had a lot of fun being challenged by the 4 black square limitation. Really brings out the improvisation and creativity muscle!~

In order to keep my creative juices flowing, I jumped from one theme to another. If, while playing around with the squares, I found the prototype more suitable if adapted for another theme, I adapted it and transferred it to the other theme. This can be seen from one of the  lego -looking shapes I created for "Order" which in turn informed a “Playful” icon down the line.


![For the brief!](/w04s1/w04s1_03.png)
In empathising with the target audience and "throwing away my darlings", I had to sacrifice designs I preferred for those that would be more recognisable for a general audience.
One example was one of my “Playful” categorys’  icons. I created a hot air balloon sailing over mountains, and I was frankly very proud that I could make that with just 4 squares. But I knew it could be interpreted instead as “travel” or “carefree”. The “read” was simply not singular enough.

Since the target audience of the icons are not defined, I held the assumption for the final choice of icon, that the icons should be immediately recognisable as if the viewer has had no prompting on what each icon should be.
