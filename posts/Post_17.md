# **Class Exercise Website Planning**

*Recreate a website*
- This exercise really put my observation of website details to shame unfortunately ðŸ¥²
- We were to recreate a website that we use often without referring to it at all: just from memory. I thought was simple enough, but it turns out it has a lot of bells and whistles I completely overlooked, such as the "storys" function and even the search bar. The exercise really made me try to pay attention to the website details more. Website UI is meant to make the navigation experience intuitive and engaging, so hopefully I can learn from the choice of functions displayed on my frequently-used websites.

*Wireframing*
- Using the references from my moodboard and some inspiration website examples shown in class, I began my wireframing. I'm thinking of having a general flow of:
1. Top: Hero Banner + name
2. 3 Assignments overview
3. Assignment 1 banner
4. A1 process
5. Final Product gallery shots + link to film
3. Assignment 2 banner
4. A2 process
5. Final Product gallery shots + link to website
3. Assignment 3 banner
4. A3 process
5. Final Product gallery shots + link to playthrough

*Iterations*
- Here are some of the different iterations I tried creating for myself. I attempted different thematic "looks" like a file-explorer based one, a thin column-like one, an abstracted shapes one and a blocky gradiented one. Will continue exploring, but I am leaning towards the look of the abstracted shapes just because I can see more possibilities for extension of the visual identity.

*Visual Identity Creation*
- I tried to link my elements, my name and my layout together in a sort of extended branding I'm creating for myself. You can see here I experiemented with the stylisations of my name to become a visual identity in itself, to varying levels of success. Will keep working on it.
