This class exercise after the lesson on the importance of storyboards was an interesting one. Storyboarding essentially boils down to breaking down a sequence into its key elements in each scene, so that directions are clear and executable. While drawing this storyboard taken from "The Night of the Living Dead" I realised stripping scenes of detail actually made the focus of the shot clearer to a hypothetical scene coordinator. One thing I would personally add to the template given after "Sound/Time" is "description", as I feel sometimes information on the content of the scene is necessary for context and understanding.

Prior to storyboarding, I felt it was essential for me to clearly define the briefs' requirements to myself. I then proceeded to expand on these elements - my personality, interests and feelings entering the program - via 4Ws 1H in a written dialogue with my inner world. Here is a small portion of that initial discussion.


![The first few ramblings](/w02s1/w02s1_d1.jpeg)
I'm aware this storyboard is wildly messy, but this helped me get out many ideas from my system.
I decided to begin from the more reflective perspective, in which I juxtaposed two scenes, and the latter being a descriptive or informative metaphor for the former. I had the idea that as much as possible these sets of scenes will be positioned or framed in a similar fashion, maximising the use of match cuts. And if that was not possible, to have the same object translated from one to anthor to create more meaning.
You can see this specifically with the first storyboard. The blank sketchbook is juxtaposed to me cooking over a stove in the same angle and positioning, to show how I enjoy cooking up new ideas...but also that I really love eating.


![The overarching plan](/w02s1/w02s1_d1w1.jpg)
The overarching direction guiding the film will be my feelings entering my program. The scenes, however, will do the work of showing a peek into my personality, interests and abilities. I wanted it to feel like a scene caught in its tracks of my life, the small associations and revelations I log as part of this season of my life. So I have decided to film these scenes as a montage-like, tabeleau-style film.

Moving forward, I have filmed several scenes displayed in the storyboard above, such as the ants juxtaposed to my scattered shoes. I will continue to try to create better cohesion and connection across my film, as it could feel rather disconnected right now. 

Additional ideas to chew on - I had the idea to intersperse shots of a daisy in between scenes,as daisys represent purity, innocence, new beginnings, joy and cheerfulness. I feel daisies represent me well in my cheerful and joyful personality, yet also help to encapsulate the feeling of new beginnings, as it very much is for me right now. 

Update: Drew the thumbnail sketches of the storyboard (19 March)

This follows the general scene progression I'm trying to bring out, which is broken into 3 sections: Excited+joyful, Anxious+lost, Hopeful.
