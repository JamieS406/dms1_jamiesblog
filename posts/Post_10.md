With this being the first time I have ever used Unity, this was a string of firsts for me, making it a particularly exciting learning experience! 

# **Unity Class exercises**

*Add Material Texture*
- I was so fascinated by all the new things I was exploring in Unity, but I especially liked adding textures to 3D objects! By changing settings on things like the Albedo and the emission, the properties of the element really come to life!

*Camera Angle*
- I think one important thing I'm learning is that you can shift the angle and perspective that the audience sees your 3D environment. I'm not too sure how that will be translating to the playable game space, but it certainly makes sense for proper framing in static 3D environment presentation.

*Light in Environment*
- I can add light sources! I'm sure this will come in very handy when I create my assignments' environment, especially if something is illuminating, like the sun I've created in the class exercise.

# **Assignment 3 Brainstorming**
- Concept Name: Repotting. A short writeup:
- Repotting is done to give a plant fresh nutrients and room for growth. This is the metaphor I am using to represent my design journey. From first being removed from the confines of my traditional academic structures, allowing me more room to deepen my foundations in design and gather new inspiration, to being literally uprooted from my home-country to expand my capabilities on foreign soil, my creative boundaries have been continually pushed beyond my comfort zones and my wildest imaginations. Though the winds of change may be daunting, this new environment might just help me stretch deeper into what I need as a designer, and reach for the stars.
