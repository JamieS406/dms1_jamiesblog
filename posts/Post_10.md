With this being the first time I have ever used Unity, this was a string of firsts for me, making it a particularly exciting learning experience! 

# **Unity Class exercises**

*Add Material Texture*
- I was so fascinated by all the new things I was exploring in Unity, but I especially liked adding textures to 3D objects! By changing settings on things like the Albedo and the emission, the properties of the element really come to life!

*Camera Angle*
- I think one important thing I'm learning is that you can shift the angle and perspective that the audience sees your 3D environment. I'm not too sure how that will be translating to the playable game space, but it certainly makes sense for proper framing in static 3D environment presentation.

*Light in Environment*
- I can add light sources! I'm sure this will come in very handy when I create my assignments' environment, especially if something is illuminating, like the sun I've created in the class exercise.
