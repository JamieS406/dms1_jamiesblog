With this being the first time I have ever used Unity, this was a string of firsts for me, making it a particularly exciting learning experience! 

# **Unity Class exercises**

*Add Material Texture*
- I was so fascinated by all the new things I was exploring in Unity, but I especially liked adding textures to 3D objects! By changing settings on things like the Albedo and the emission, the properties of the element really come to life!

*Camera Angle*
- I think one important thing I'm learning is that you can shift the angle and perspective that the audience sees your 3D environment. I'm not too sure how that will be translating to the playable game space, but it certainly makes sense for proper framing in static 3D environment presentation.

*Light in Environment*
- I can add light sources! I'm sure this will come in very handy when I create my assignments' environment, especially if something is illuminating, like the sun I've created in the class exercise.

# **Assignment 3 Brainstorming**
**Concept Name - Repotting** 
- A short writeup:
- Repotting is done to give a plant fresh nutrients and room for growth. This is the metaphor I am using to represent my design journey. From first being removed from the confines of my traditional academic structures, allowing me more room to deepen my foundations in design and gather new inspiration, to being literally uprooted from my home-country to expand my capabilities on foreign soil, my creative boundaries have been continually pushed beyond my comfort zones and my wildest imaginations. Though the winds of change may be daunting, this new environment might just help me stretch deeper into what I need as a designer, and reach for the stars. 

**Moodboard and progress breakdown**
![Assignment 3 Moodboard](/w07s1/w07s1_mbA3.png)

- Here is the moodboard for my 3d space. It will be split into a 3-phase progression: the initial state, the transition state, and the final state. The images here are also layed out from left to right in that arrangment.
1. **Initial State (stuck in the pot)** 
* *Feelings to achieve*: 
Clastrophobic,  dark, subduing, intimidating. 
- This was the initial state of my design life - or rather, the repression of it. In early childhood, I was placed in the strict environment of the traditional school system, that did not take kindly to a creative mind. Systematic subjects like Math and Sciences were always an enigmatic nightmare, and it was at times torture to stop myself from flying away in my mind. I also come from a society and culture that prides itself in systematic efficiency, favours academic success and career paths that guarantee a hefty, stable paycheck. I was fortunate that growing up, I one of the lucky ones who were still allowed to cultivate that little spark of creativity in my life, and that growth was never crushed out by those I loved. However, aspirationally, society loomed over my creative mind, telling me that creative work will always be a pipe dream in a grounded world.

* Table model/block

2. **Transition State (branching out)** 
* *Feelings to achieve*: 
Small hope, anticipation, apprehension, curiosity
- I reached a cross-roads in my design life two major times, and the prospects were often eerily similar: stick to the safe options and get stable, predictable results, or jump into the deep end and grow out of your comfort zone? Stick to the pot (plot), or grow into the great beyond, seeing where it takes you? Both times, I took the plunge. When you're suddenly given room to grow it can really feel like you're falling. At times I didn't know if i was going up or going down. But with each new experience, each new growth, I deepened my knowledge to design in ways I never thought possible. And so did my love and passion for the craft, expanding into my strong suits and reaching for new ambitions.
* -- Assets Required --

3. **Final State (sky is the limit)** 
* *Feelings to achieve*: 
Wonder, freedom, wide-open expansive joy
- Now growing into my craft feels like I'm growing up and out, accelerating at rates I never new possible. It is wonderfully freeing to love the things you work at, as it frees you to own it wholeheartedly too. I know one day the horizon I see will look like a tunneled pot again, but a tree cannot thrive in a pot. It will keep growing and growing, from one plot to the next, until it reaches the stars.
