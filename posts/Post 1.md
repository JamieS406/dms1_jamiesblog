Since this book could possibly be one of a few sections, we looked at 3 sections for where this could be: Arts, Technology or Technology and Communication. We bet on the last section, and tried to get as many books about Digital Media as we could into the frame. We're betting on 4 books...we hope at least one meets the criteria. 1 in 4 chance?

![Hanging Paper Net](/w01s1/sh_papernet.webp)
We found this quick and easy! Since we were at the library to find the Digital Media book, we looked out the window and saw the pretty paper net cascading down. A satisfyingly simple find ðŸ˜Š

This space smoothly transitioned from the library space...and was no challenge at all the locate. The force is strong with us today.

![Drinks from the Sky](/w01s1/sh_vendingmachine/webp)
I was very confused as to what this was, and I kept trying to find an elaborate, Willy Wonka style sculpture. But smart Henry quickly figured out it was a vending machine. I'm honestly glad someone else has brains, because I don't think I would have thought of that ðŸ˜‚

![Jail](/w01s1/sh_jail/webp)
Originally I couldn't imagine what this would be either, but thankfully it seemed my other teammates had explored the alumni court and found the convict-themed escape room beyond the gates. I think we blocked the door a little, sorry about that.

![Blackbox](/w01s1/sh_blackbox/webp)
A quick search and look around the lower levels of the main building brought us to blackbox pretty easily. It looked a little dark inside...I guess "black box" is truly a fitting name.

![Explosive Coffee](/w01s1/sh_coffee.webp)
One of the most difficult of the items to find, this elusive coffee joint had running in circles, mistaking it for other cafes, and staring at each other in disbelief. Seriously, it shouldn't have been that hard...but it was.

![Apes Hands](/w01s1/sh_ape.webp)
We knew exactly where this one was! I think we passed it quite a few times during orientation, so this was quickly located with a bit of walking.

![Golden Globe](/w01s1/sh_goldenglobe/webp)
After the STRONG hint at one item being beyond the rectangular section of the map, we decided to venture out to that dimpled-out section. Originally we speculated the item could be a sculpture above building 8, but we quickly realised it was a towering monument perched on a row of 8s in the field behind the school!

![Curtain of roots with winged visitor](/w01s1/sh_roots/webp)
This was the last one we managed to track down, and with significant effort and some asking around. We kept trying to look for a sculpture with wings, not realising the motif on the ground of the sculpture represented an eagle! Here you can see us trying to get the sculpture into frame, without burning our skin or retinas from the glaring sun. Alls well that ends well, I guess.
