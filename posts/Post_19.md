- *Feedback*
- Showing my website to my classmates, I got some valuable feedback to use.
- Anna kindly pointed out the consistency of the designs helped to create cohesion, which was positive feedback I appreciated.
- Milo mentioned the slideshow-like progression of the website I've created seems to be working, and translating that moving forward would do well for the design. He also mentioned that the grey arrows I place should be consistent and all click-able.

- *Extra*
- I also appears that my profile was much appreciated during the review.
- In all seriousness though, I am thinking of perhaps resizing the profile, as at the moment it looks a little boring and almost corporate.
