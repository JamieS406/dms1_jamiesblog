**Assignment 1 - Video Edit**
• *How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of your edit?*
I first planned out the overview of my film’s storyline and flow, then identified the main emotions within key sections. I also earmarked specific scenes that would need additional sound effects to enhance the emotion/concept I wanted to convey. This helped to give me a general framework to work with to look for soundtracks and sound effects. I took pains to transition the visual components in tandem to the soundtrack’s tempo and ensure as much synchresis as possible, down to syncing the sound effects to the soundtrack as well.

• *How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?*
I started with my personal story and the main emotions I felt during the time I moved to Melbourne to study. This helped me identify 3 main categories of emotion. Though I did not define what scenes to shoot from the get-go, I was able to look out for scenes around me that fit one of the main categories I set for myself. This allowed me to create a repository of relevant footage that I could mix and match as I went along, which gave me creative freedom to get more opportunistic shots that catch my eye at a given time. I also gave myself the additional challenge to not film my face at all, so it made me think of creative ways to convey my thoughts symbolically/metaphorically in alternative ways.

• *What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how did you apply this knowledge to your project?*
Sound is able to powerfully manipulate tone, to either enhance or subvert the visual information. It preps the viewer on the nature of the work and guides the viewer as to what to feel, to allow the viewer to more acutely understand and interpret the artist’s intention.

• *How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use these concepts to shape your use of time in the project?*
Editing is able to direct the emphasis of the work appropriately throughout the work, so that the “introductory”, “climax” and “conclusion” hierarchy are clearly defined, which helps the viewer to properly understand the artist’s main message. In my edit, I divided the timing between my 3 main sections quite equally, but gave a little more time to my “transitionary” section’s timing, which was in the middle. This helped to emphasize the struggle I felt and how, emotionally and mentally, it felt longer and harder to figure out. 

• *Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to depict in your portrait?*
As the overarching story, I chose to depict my move to Melbourne from my home country, Singapore, and the emotions I felt going through it. Throughout the film, though, I showed bits of my personality and interests. I wanted it to feel like a scene caught in its tracks of my life, the small associations and revelations I log as part of this season of my life. For example, I showed some of my illustrations, my love for nature, my anxious nature, my pets, and the little ‘boring’ things around me that others ignore, but I find interesting and notice, like the shredded wall and its interesting texture.

• *What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your work?*
I used a montage-like, tabeleau style which was able to capture ‘still’ videos, snapshots of moments in time that I noticed like memories. In a wabi-sabi fashion, I captured life as-is, finding the beauty and wonder in imperfection. This gave a sentimental, genuine feeling, as if the viewer is going through an album of my memories with me and reliving the journey. I also heavily utilized patterns, match cuts and symbolism, therefore the way in which my scenes were compiled was meticulous and very intentional. These methods are simple to execute yet powerful in storytelling, which allowed me to use the limitation on effects and transitions fully to my advantage.

**Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons**
• *How would you summarise your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose the theme that you did?*
For Assignment 2, I decided on the topic "Dream". It imagines a world where dream-travel and manipulation has been made possible, much like the movie "Inception". The icons created are to navigate and manipulate the dreamscape effectively, with safeguards around the dream perimeters if the traveler so requires.
I chose this particular direction because it is novel enough a set of functions for me to create icons that have not been created before, thus giving me sufficient creative freedom. However, it is also limited enough a scope as my icons are limited to functions to use within a dreamscape, therefore giving me proper boundaries for exploration that I would not be overwhelmed by what I would have to create to have a “complete” set of functions. This is a problem I could run into if I were to, say, create a new game and then realise I need more than 9 icons to make everything make sense.

• *Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed across those iterations, and why did you choose the one that you ended up with?*
I iterated relentlessly throughout my process. Even ones that I initially really liked, I pushed myself to try making alternatives to make the icons even better.
 I first identified specific “dreamlike” iconography designs and continuously iterated different styles, shapes, proportions, contrast levels and orientations of the icons. My primary criteria when creating the icons was that it’s function had to be clear, it had to be visible even from afar (ie. Contrast has to be sufficient), and it had to look cohesive with the other icons. I continued iterating or began refining depending on whether the icons adhered to these criteria.

• *How did you translate your thumbnail sketches into the final flat designs in Illustrator? Was anything lost in that translation, or gained?*
I created my very first thumbnail sketches on illustrator already, so no, nothing really lost in translation. Although at times the charm of the hand-drawn icons can be lost when brought into vectorized, clean-edged illustrator shape form.

• *How did you use colour to create a sense of unity and visual interest in the icons? Why did you choose the palette that you did?*
- I limited myself to 2 main colours, and every icon had to had both within the design, in larger or smaller amounts. This helped to create visual uniformity and cohesion. I also had an indigo-and-blue gradient feature within select icons as well, for visual interest.
- I decided on an analogous mixture of indigo and blue colours. Indigo represents tranquility and also mystery, It is able to be deeply relaxing yet intriguingly unknown, which perfectly encapsulates the experience of dream travelling. I chose a more vibrant indigo, borrowing inspiration from the neon quality of sci-fi palettes. Blue is a very relaxing colour and a good supporting colour for indigo.

• *How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design?*
- I tried to have my sounds “transition” at the same time my icons transitioned. For example, if there was a transitional sound of gravity dropping, I would cut my sound effect’s timing to the same number of seconds that it takes for my icon to switch to its next state.
- I also tried to “standardize” the sound effect types of the different icons, so that they also would sound like they belonged in a dreamy, sci-fi type of genre.

• *How did you translate the prompt that you chose from an abstract idea to a set of concrete visual designs?*
I attached the concept of “Dream” to a movie with scenes and existing lore, which helped guide me in my design choices as I was able to inform myself through additional research different ways of the types of icons I could create and the type of world the dreamscape was.

**Assignment 3 - Virtual Environment**
• *How important was a working prototype to your design process? What did it offer that process?*
To be honest I created prototypes quickly and did not end up with a “perfect” draft before I started on the actual models. However, the prototyping process in grey-boxxing was imperative. I was able to quickly realise a straight, narrow corridor, which was what I had previously planned for, did not adequately deliver my creative intention of claustrophobia and confusion. This prompted me to try circular, more winding routes, lower ceiling lines and walls that were not just narrow but angled too.

• *How did your experience of designing and producing a three-dimensional environment differ from your experience of designing and producing a project in two-dimensional media?*
It was significantly different for me. 
- In a two-dimensional space, I only had to check my alignments on 2 planes, so my control of the medium was quite easy and straightforward. However in a three-dimensional environment, I can align things to the centre on one plane, and when I shift to a different angle, it becomes misaligned! Zeroing doesn’t always help either, as some object’s centres are not the same as others. This made me have to “turn” the editor display in many more different angles than I would have a two-dimensional environment to ensure correct alignment.
- Three-dimensional environment design also means lighting and element proximity matters! These were added challenges I had to straddle and accommodate for.
- Finally, the “design” created in a 2D format is as-is. What you see is what you get. However, the 3D environment can look very different in “play” mode than in editing mode. This difference in look means that I have to work harder to ensure the playthrough and my creative intention aligns.

• *What was the role of the virtual camera in your project, and how was it similar to and different from the role of the camera in Assignment 1?*
- The virtual camera framed the area of the environment one was focusing on editing at any given moment. It was similar to the camera in Assignment 1, in how they showed the audience’s point of view of the scene. It was different to Assignment 1 in that the virtual camera in the player’s viewpoint can change and rove around the area, giving the player control of where to “point” the camera wherever they please. Meanwhile, the audience in Assignment 1’s film is restricted to what the filmmaker decides to turn the camera on in the scene.

• *How did you use sound in your project, and how was this similar to and different from your use of sound in Assignments 1 and 2?*
I used sound in my project to set the tone for each space, especially the “initial state” and the “final state” ambient music. This was like Assignment 1’s music choices in tandem with the emotional tone of the film, and similar to Assignment 2’s choice of sound effect based on the sci-fi theme. It was, however, a little different to these 2 assignments in that there was an added dimension of distance. Therefore, I also had to plan for how the proximity of the player affected certain sound effects, like going closer to the portal would make the glitter and ambient sound effects louder. This would prompt players to go closer to the portal and guide the player along.

• *How did you unify the different elements of your virtual environment under a certain theme or concept? How did your theme or concept evolve over the project’s development?*
I ensured certain elements remained constant throughout the journey. For example, there was a constant presence of clouds and tree roots/branches, which had significant symbolism in the whole process. I also ensured that the environment had a relatively consistent colour palette of early browns/greens, and light blues + yellows. More browns and greens were in the initial state, while more blues and yellows were in the final state, yet all the colours were present in each state, just in different proportions.

• *What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldn’t have discovered otherwise?*
I always found little bugs and happy accidents while play testing.
For bugs in my personal playthrough, I would find things like gaps I fell through, faulty stairs, incorrect sound effect spread, strange lighting, incorrectly placed elements and so much more.
In getting others to play test my work, I found that people could climb my tree branches, fall off the edges of borders and even phase through my walls. This was very helpful to fix the errors I would otherwise have missed.
I found some happy accidents as well, such as the big tree in the final state being visible through the translucent ceiling on the second floor I also noticed the terrain could be manipulated around the first level to make the “soil” look more realistic over the pot-section walls.
